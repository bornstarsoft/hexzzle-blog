November 2025 marked a historic low for video game hardware and software sales in the US, with 1.6 million units soldthe worst performance for the month since tracking began 30 years ago. This decline is particularly striking given that November typically sees a surge in sales due to Black Friday and holiday shopping. However, the average price for a new gaming console reached an all-time high of $439, which likely deterred many potential buyers.

The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed closely by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. In terms of software, spending on physical games fell by 14% compared to last year, indicating a shift towards digital sales that are not reflected in these numbers. The latest installment of the Call of Duty series, despite being the top-selling game, also experienced a decline in sales, highlighting the challenges facing traditional gaming revenue streams.

As the gaming industry navigates these turbulent waters, the question remains: how will console manufacturers adapt to rising costs and shifting consumer preferences? The future of dedicated gaming devices may hinge on their ability to innovate and offer value amidst these economic pressures.
