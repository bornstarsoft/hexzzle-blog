In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will officially go offline on January 31, 2027. This announcement follows their decision to step back from MMO development, leaving players with only a year to enjoy the game before it is permanently delisted. As of today, New World has already been removed from storefronts like Steam and the Xbox store, marking the end of an era for this ambitious title.

Players who have previously purchased New World will still have access to download and install the game, but they will be unable to play it once the servers shut down. Amazon has expressed gratitude to the community for their support and passion, emphasizing that the journey through Aeternum has been a shared adventure. The Nighthaven season will be extended until the servers go offline, giving players a final chance to experience the game together.

As we look forward to this last year, it raises questions about the future of MMO gaming and how communities will adapt to the closure of beloved titles. Will players find new worlds to explore, or will they hold onto the memories crafted in Aeternum? Only time will tell.
