NINES has just unveiled their upcoming puzzle game, Pipeworks Puzzle, and it promises to bring a refreshing twist to the classic tile sliding genre. Set against a charming backdrop with adorable visuals and soothing soundtracks, this game invites players to step into the shoes of a plumber at a bustling construction site. The objective? Rearranging disordered pipe pieces to match a provided blueprint and successfully connect them all. 

What sets Pipeworks Puzzle apart is not just its engaging gameplay but also the inclusion of a support character named ‘Boss’, designed by the talented PokuriMio. This character will guide players from novice to master plumber, enhancing the overall gaming experience. With movement restricted to the cardinal directions, players will need to think strategically as they navigate through the grid-based arena. 

Currently, Pipeworks Puzzle is available for wishlisting on Steam, with the promise of unlocking exciting features like an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and even a cat companion as players progress. A demo is on the horizon, making it the perfect time to follow and add this title to your wishlist. Will you be ready to tackle the pipes when it launches later this year?
