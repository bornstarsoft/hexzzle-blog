In a significant move, Rovio Entertainment has announced the layoff of 36 staff members, primarily due to the underperformance of its mobile game, Angry Birds Dream Blast. Launched in 2018, this puzzle spin-off has not met the financial expectations set by the studio, prompting a restructuring aimed at enhancing game quality and better aligning with its parent company, Sega.

The layoffs include senior staff who were integral to the development of Angry Birds Dream Blast. Rovio's spokesperson indicated that while no games have been canceled, the company is reorganizing to adopt a more game-centric approach. This includes creating new business units and reallocating resources to respond more effectively to market demands.

With Sega's acquisition of Rovio in August 2023, the studio is not only looking to improve its mobile offerings but also aims to expand beyond mobile gaming. As Rovio navigates these changes, it will be interesting to see how these strategic shifts impact its future projects and the broader gaming landscape.
