For over 35 years, Nintendo has delighted fans with a musical easter egg known as Totaka’s Song, and it has recently made its 25th appearance in Mario Kart World. This catchy 19-note melody, crafted by sound designer Kazumi Totaka, has been cleverly hidden in numerous Nintendo titles, making it a beloved secret among gamers. The latest discovery involves players waiting on the character select screen until Yoshi begins to hum the iconic tune, blending nostalgia with the thrill of discovery.

Totaka’s Song first surfaced in the Game Boy title X back in 1990, and since then, it has been a delightful surprise in 24 different games, including classics like Pikmin 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. The connection between Yoshi and Totaka is particularly special, as Totaka has lent his voice to the character since 1998. This ongoing legacy not only enriches the gaming experience but also showcases Nintendo's commitment to detail and fan engagement.

As we continue to explore the ever-evolving landscape of gaming, it’s fascinating to see how such hidden gems can create lasting connections between players and their favorite franchises. What other secrets do you think Nintendo has tucked away in its games waiting to be discovered?
