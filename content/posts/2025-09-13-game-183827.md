The buzz around the next Super Mario Bros movie has intensified with recent developments suggesting that its title may have leaked. An image of limited-edition Old Spice deodorant cans featuring Luigi and Yoshi, branded with the title "The Super Mario Galaxy Movie," surfaced two months ago, but many dismissed it as a hoax. However, new domain registrations by NBCUniversal have lent credibility to this leak, indicating that the title might indeed be legitimate.

The deodorant cans, which include scents like "Desert Detour" for Luigi and "Brooklyn Bounce" for Yoshi, hint at intriguing plot elements for the upcoming film. The registrations of domain names such as "supermariogalaxy.movie" suggest that Universal is preparing for a significant marketing push, potentially confirming that the sequel will explore new worlds and characters from the beloved franchise.

As fans eagerly await the official announcement, the speculation surrounding the movie's title and storyline raises exciting questions about what adventures await our favorite characters. Will we see Luigi in a desert setting and Yoshi in New York? Only time will tell as we look forward to the upcoming Nintendo Direct for more insights.
