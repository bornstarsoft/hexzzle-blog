In an exciting move that highlights the intersection of gaming and employee recognition, ShiftUp has gifted all 300 of its employees a Nintendo Switch 2. This gesture comes in celebration of the action-adventure game "Stella Blade," which has surpassed 3 million units in sales. CEO Kim Hyung-sik emphasized that this initiative is part of a broader strategy to foster an environment where talent is rewarded based on performance.

The company previously celebrated the launch of "Stella Blade" by providing employees with PlayStation 5 Pro consoles, showcasing a commitment to not only game development but also to employee satisfaction. With the success of "Stella Blade," there are even discussions about developing a Switch 2 version of the game, indicating the title's strong market presence and potential for future growth.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it's clear that companies like ShiftUp are recognizing the importance of rewarding their teams in innovative ways. What other creative incentives do you think could emerge in the gaming sector as it grows?
