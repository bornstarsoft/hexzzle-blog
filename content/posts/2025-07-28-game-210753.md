A new video game based on the iconic Friday the 13th franchise is officially in the works, reigniting excitement among fans of horror gaming. Announced during a San Diego Comic-Con panel, Robert Barsamian, executive vice president at Horror Inc, confirmed that both a sequel game and a new movie are top priorities for the franchise, which has been dormant for years.

While details remain scarce, Barsamian hinted that the upcoming game may not be a direct follow-up to 2017's Friday the 13th: The Game, which was a hit among fans for its asymmetrical multiplayer gameplay. The original game faced challenges after its license expired, leading to its removal from sale, but the new project aims to bring the beloved hockey-mask-wearing villain back to life in a fresh format.

As Jason Universe, the new enterprise managing the franchise, gears up for this exciting revival, fans are left wondering what innovative gameplay mechanics and storylines will be introduced. With the horror genre continuously evolving, this sequel game could set new standards for future horror titles. What are your thoughts on what this new game could bring to the table?
