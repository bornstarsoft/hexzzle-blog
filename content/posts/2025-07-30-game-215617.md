This July marks a significant milestone for VGC as we celebrate our first anniversary on Patreon, a platform that has transformed how we engage with our community. Over the past year, we've produced a wealth of bonus content, including videos and podcasts, while also introducing features like ad-free browsing on our website. The support from our patrons has been invaluable, especially during challenging times in the media landscape.

To commemorate this special occasion, were excited to announce a month filled with exclusive content in August, including vlogs from our teams global adventures and our first-ever merchandise offer. Patrons can look forward to unique insights from events like the Pokmon World Championships and a special vlog from Japan, showcasing the vibrant gaming culture there.

As we step into our second year, were also rolling out exclusive VGC logo badges for our patrons, a token of appreciation for their support. Whether youre a long-time supporter or considering joining, theres never been a better time to be part of the VGC community. What exclusive content are you most excited to see in the coming month?
