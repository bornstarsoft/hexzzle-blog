The gaming community can breathe a sigh of relief as Limited Run Games announces that the Gex Trilogy is back in action on the Nintendo Switch 2. After being temporarily delisted from the eShop due to startup issues related to the console's backwards compatibility, a patch has been successfully implemented, allowing players to enjoy this classic title once again.

Limited Run Games took the proactive step of requesting Nintendo to remove Gex Trilogy from sale until the issues were resolved. The patch, which has now been approved, addresses the compatibility problems that arose from the use of Limited Run's Carbon Engine, the technology behind many of their retro re-releases. This not only resolves the immediate concerns for Gex Trilogy but also reflects the company's commitment to ensuring a smooth gaming experience for its customers.

While Gex Trilogy is still unavailable for purchase on the Switch 2 eShop, it's expected to be reinstated soon, allowing new players to dive into the nostalgia. With this patch, Limited Run has also addressed issues with 12 other titles affected by the same compatibility problems, showcasing their dedication to quality and customer satisfaction.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how Limited Run continues to innovate and support its titles on new platforms. Will this prompt other developers to prioritize backward compatibility in their releases? Only time will tell.
