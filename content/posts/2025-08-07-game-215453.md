The excitement is building for the upcoming NASCAR 25 console game, developed by iRacing, as they recently unveiled the complete driver roster. This highly anticipated game, set to release on October 14 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, features a staggering 176 real-world NASCAR drivers across various series, including the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series, NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and ARCA Menards Series. 

Among the notable names included are fan favorites like Denny Hamlin, Chase Elliott, and Kyle Larson, but the roster does have some surprising omissions, such as Katherine Legge. The inclusion of drivers across multiple series adds an exciting layer to gameplay, allowing players to engage with their favorite racers in different contexts. With 45 drivers in the Cup Series alone, the diversity and depth of the roster promise to enhance the gaming experience significantly.

As we approach the release date, fans are left wondering how these drivers will perform in the game and what unique features iRacing will introduce to capture the thrill of NASCAR racing. Will this game set a new standard for racing simulations? Only time will tell.
