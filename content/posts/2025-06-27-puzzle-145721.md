Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is generating buzz with its innovative blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. Revealed in a recent gameplay video, players will engage in a unique experience where they hack robots through a mini-game while simultaneously dodging and shooting at them. This dual-layered gameplay promises to keep players on their toes, offering a fresh take on the action-adventure genre.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, Pragmata introduces players to Hugh, a skilled spaceman, and his android companion, Diana. The game's narrative and setting are as intriguing as its mechanics, showcasing Capcom's commitment to crafting a compelling original IP. Despite several delays since its announcement in June 2020, the polished gameplay seen in previews has left fans eager for more.

As we look forward to its release in 2026, one can't help but wonder how Capcom will expand on these ideas throughout the game's extensive playtime. With the company's strong track record in modern gaming, there's plenty of reason to be optimistic about Pragmata's potential.
