After two decades of anticipation, the long-lost game Navinosuke: The Yo-Kai Buster, developed by the original Metal Slug team, is set to make its debut on the Nintendo Switch in 2026. This announcement has ignited excitement among gaming enthusiasts, as it marks the revival of a title that was completed but never released due to various circumstances. The game, described as a “phantom RPG,” promises a nostalgic journey through Japanese folklore, featuring over 150 yokai companions.

Director Shinano Ishiguro revealed that the game was initially designed for the Game Boy Advance and was ahead of its time, even incorporating a GPS element that would have allowed players to explore the real world. Although that feature was ultimately scrapped, the team persevered, modifying the game to ensure it could be enjoyed without GPS functionality. The narrative centers around a wooden doll containing the spirit of a girl aspiring to become an onmyoji, traveling across Japan to seal and befriend monsters, which adds a rich layer of cultural storytelling.

As we look forward to the Switch release, one can't help but wonder how this game might have changed the landscape of mobile gaming had it launched alongside Pokémon GO. With its unique premise and the legacy of its developers, Navinosuke has the potential to capture the hearts of both nostalgic gamers and a new generation alike. Will this long-awaited release live up to the hype?
