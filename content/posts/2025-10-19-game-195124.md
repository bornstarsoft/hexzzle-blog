The long-awaited release of "Infinity on Game Boy Color" is finally on the horizon, set to launch in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, which has been two decades in the making, promises to deliver a unique strategic battle system and an engaging narrative that has captured the hearts of retro gaming enthusiasts. Originally developed by Affinix Software, the game faced cancellation in 2002, but thanks to Incube8 Games and a successful crowdfunding campaign, it is now being revived for a new generation of players.

Infinity offers an epic tale of ancient evil and conflict between rival nations, all set against the backdrop of beautifully crafted 8-bit graphics. Players will explore over 30 areas, engage with five playable characters, and navigate a world filled with over 100 items. The games rich narrative and innovative gameplay mechanics are sure to immerse players in a nostalgic yet fresh experience.

As we anticipate the release, it's exciting to see how this once-abandoned project has transformed into a fully realized RPG. Will Infinity redefine the retro gaming landscape, or will it simply be a nostalgic trip down memory lane? Only time will tell!
