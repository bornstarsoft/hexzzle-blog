In a significant legal victory, Nintendo has secured a $2 million settlement from Ryan Daly, a Michigan-based seller of modded Switch consoles. This case underscores the serious implications of selling modded gaming hardware, especially when it involves circumventing copyright protections. Daly, who operated under the name Modded Hardware, initially denied wrongdoing but ultimately agreed to the settlement, which includes a permanent injunction preventing him from engaging in any future sales of modded devices.

The lawsuit, filed in July 2024, highlighted Daly's continued sales of unauthorized modding devices even after Nintendo had warned him to cease operations. This case serves as a critical reminder for both sellers and consumers about the legal risks associated with modding consoles, particularly when it involves piracy. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, how will companies like Nintendo adapt their strategies to combat such practices in the future?
