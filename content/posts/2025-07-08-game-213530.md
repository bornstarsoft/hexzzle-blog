In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has publicly denied rumors of its closure, despite facing significant funding challenges for its unannounced first-person shooter project. The studio, co-founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, confirmed last week that it lost financial backing from a publisher, later identified as Microsoft, which has recently undergone sweeping layoffs affecting thousands of employees.

Romero Games emphasized that it is actively exploring new partnerships with several interested publishers to revive its project. The studio's commitment to transparency is evident in their statement, where they clarify that while funding was withdrawn, they are not shutting down operations. This news comes as a relief to fans and supporters who have rallied behind the studio during this tumultuous period.

As the gaming industry continues to navigate financial uncertainties, the resilience of studios like Romero Games highlights the importance of community support and strategic partnerships. Will Romero Games find the backing it needs to bring its vision to life? Only time will tell.
