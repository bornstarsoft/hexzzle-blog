In a remarkable display of generosity, Shift Up Corporation, a prominent game developer, has gifted every one of its 300 employees an Apple Watch, Apple AirPods Max, and a bonus of 5 million KRW. This initiative, announced during their New Year kickoff ceremony, highlights the companys commitment to employee satisfaction and morale, especially after a successful year marked by the release of popular titles like Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Stellar Blade.

This isnt the first time Shift Up has surprised its employees with extravagant gifts. Last year, employees received an iPhone 14 along with a bonus, and to celebrate the companys 10th anniversary, they were given a credit card preloaded with 10 million KRW. Such initiatives not only foster a positive work environment but also reflect the companys strong financial performance, with impressive revenue and profit margins reported in 2024.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other companies respond to Shift Up's approach to employee engagement. Will we see a trend of more companies following suit in rewarding their teams?
