Konami is set to delight fans with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer, bringing classic titles to the Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC. Scheduled for launch on July 2, this compilation will feature beloved entries from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, making it a nostalgic trip down memory lane for gamers.

While the collection is currently only confirmed for release in Japan, it promises exciting new features such as rewind, quick save, and a music player, enhancing the gameplay experience for both new players and long-time fans. The inclusion of a gallery showcasing each game's instruction manual adds a unique touch that celebrates the history of the series.

As we look forward to the release, one can't help but wonder if Konami will consider a global launch, allowing more fans worldwide to enjoy the whimsical adventures of Goemon. Will this collection spark a revival of interest in retro gaming? Only time will tell.
