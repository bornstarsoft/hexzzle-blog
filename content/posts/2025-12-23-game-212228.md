The Octopath Traveler series has officially surpassed 6 million units sold, a significant milestone for Square Enix. This impressive figure includes both physical shipments and digital downloads of the original Octopath Traveler, its sequel, Octopath Traveler II, and the newly introduced Octopath Traveler 0. This achievement comes just a year after the series celebrated reaching 5 million sales, showcasing the growing popularity of these titles among gamers worldwide.

The first game in the series, which launched to critical acclaim, has sold over 3 million units since its release, while Octopath Traveler II has made its mark with 1 million units sold by June 2023. To celebrate this success, Square Enix is offering a 60% discount on the first two games during the holiday season, making it a perfect opportunity for new players to dive into this captivating RPG universe.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how Square Enix builds on this success and what new adventures await in the Octopath Traveler series. Will we see more expansions or entirely new titles in the future? Only time will tell.
