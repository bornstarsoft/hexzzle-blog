A recent video showcasing the Nintendo Switch 2 booting up for the first time has generated significant buzz among gaming enthusiasts. Shared by the Russian Telegram channel Pops & Culture, the 41-second clip captures the console's initial setup screen, where users select their preferred system language. This glimpse into the console's early functionality has fans eagerly anticipating its official release, which is just over a week away.

While the video offers a tantalizing look at the Switch 2, it also hints at some limitations. Early access users appear to be restricted to this basic setup, with the full range of features—including game access—locked behind a mandatory day one update that has yet to be released. This situation raises questions about the console's launch and the potential for further leaks as the release date approaches.

As we count down to the launch, the excitement surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to build. Will this new console live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor? Only time will tell, but for now, the gaming community is buzzing with anticipation.
