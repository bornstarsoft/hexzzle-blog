As we gear up for 2026, SEGA is not only celebrating Sonic the Hedgehog's 35th anniversary but also honoring the beloved puzzle game Puyo Puyo. The company has unveiled the "Dairensa!" project, which promises a series of exciting initiatives to commemorate this milestone. From themed artwork to a special live stream featuring voice actors and game demos, fans can look forward to a year filled with nostalgia and celebration.

In addition to the live stream on February 1, 2026, SEGA is launching pop-up stores in major Japanese cities, offering exclusive merchandise and events. The collaboration between Sonic and Puyo Puyo will further enhance the festivities, with a lottery featuring unique prizes. This dual celebration highlights SEGA's commitment to its legacy and its fans, ensuring that both franchises receive the recognition they deserve.
