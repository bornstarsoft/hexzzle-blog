The Tokyo Monorail is set to launch an exciting real-world puzzle game in collaboration with the beloved Little Twin Stars, running from November 14, 2025, to February 28, 2026. This event invites participants to embark on a journey along the monorail line, where they will decode ciphers and solve puzzles, all while exploring iconic locations. With two beginner-friendly routesthe Kiki Route from Hamamatsucho Station and the Lala Route from Haneda Airportthis experience promises to be both fun and engaging for families and puzzle enthusiasts alike.

Participants will receive a kit containing a puzzle booklet, a clip pen, and discount coupons, all for a participation fee of 2,000 yen. The first 1,000 participants will also be rewarded with a special ballpoint pen charm, while those who complete both routes will gain access to exclusive smartphone wallpapers.
