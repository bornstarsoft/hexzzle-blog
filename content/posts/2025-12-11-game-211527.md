The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Triangle Wave's innovative puzzle game, Stretchmancer, has been picked up by Offbrand Games.

Set in a vibrant universe, players take on the role of a reptile-like Stretchmancer, utilizing unique mechanics to manipulate the environment. With voice-acted dialogue and an original soundtrack, the game promises an immersive experience that goes beyond traditional puzzle-solving.

As we await its release on PC, one can't help but wonder: will Stretchmancer redefine the boundaries of puzzle games and inspire a new wave of creativity in game design? Stay tuned for more updates as this exciting journey unfolds!
