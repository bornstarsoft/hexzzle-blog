In a troubling turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-discussed game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could impact over 100 employees. This news comes as the studio embarks on a 45-day consultation process, a requirement under UK law when layoffs exceed 100 staff members. With an estimated 300 employees based in the UK, this situation raises significant concerns about the studio's future and the ongoing issues surrounding its latest release.

Since the launch of MindsEye on June 10, players have inundated social media with complaints about technical glitches and bugs, leading to an unprecedented response from PlayStation, which has begun issuing refunds. This scenario echoes the infamous launch of Cyberpunk 2077, where similar issues prompted widespread backlash and a temporary removal from sale. The studio's heartfelt apology indicates their commitment to player satisfaction, but the financial and reputational damage may already be substantial.

As the gaming community watches closely, the outcome of this consultation process could set a precedent for how studios handle post-launch crises. Will Build a Rocket Boy manage to recover from this setback, or will it become another cautionary tale in the gaming industry? Only time will tell.
