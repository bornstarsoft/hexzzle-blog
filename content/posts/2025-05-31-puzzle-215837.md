The anticipation for Pokémon Legends Z-A is reaching new heights as My Nintendo Store UK unveils its enticing pre-order bonuses. Gamers who secure their copy early will be treated to a delightful partner Pokémon figurine featuring fan favorites Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile. But that's just the beginning; several themed bundles, including Mega Evolution, Trainer, and Champion’s Choice, will also offer exclusive items like pins, a baseball cap, a mug, and a figurine of the iconic Mega Charizard.

While the specifics of which items accompany each game version remain under wraps, eager players can sign up on the My Nintendo website for updates.
