Gamirror Games is set to captivate puzzle enthusiasts with the upcoming release of AiliA, a visually stunning mirror-based puzzle game that promises to redefine the genre. Launching on January 9, 2026, at 15:00 (UTC+8) on Steam, AiliA invites players to step into a mesmerizing world where reality intertwines with its mirrored counterpart. As players guide Aria, a young girl on a quest to rescue her twin sister, they will engage in a unique gameplay experience that emphasizes spatial awareness and creative problem-solving.

The game features seven beautifully crafted stages inspired by Eastern aesthetics, each filled with over 100 intricate puzzles that challenge players to manipulate mirrors to reshape their environment.
