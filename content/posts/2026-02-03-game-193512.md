In an exciting development for football gaming enthusiasts, Netflix is set to launch a new FIFA game, spearheaded by Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer of Konami's Fox Engine. This game aims to reimagine the FIFA series from the ground up, especially now that the brand is no longer associated with EA Sports. With Merceron's extensive experience in developing football games, including his work on the acclaimed Metal Gear Solid 5 and the Pro Evolution Soccer series, fans can expect a fresh and engaging gaming experience.

Delphi Interactive, the studio behind this ambitious project, is collaborating with Refactor Games to ensure that the new FIFA game captures the essence of what made football games beloved in the past. Merceron emphasizes a return to core creative principles, focusing on fun and feel, which he believes are essential for appealing to a broader audience. The game will be available as part of a Netflix subscription, allowing players to use their mobile phones as controllers, making it accessible and innovative.

As we look forward to the game's release in time for the World Cup, it raises an intriguing question: how will this new approach to football gaming redefine the genre and the way fans engage with their favorite sport? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is palpable.
