In an exciting turn of events for retro gaming enthusiasts, the long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback. This revival is the result of a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation, culminating in a fully polished cartridge edition set to release in 2025. Priced at $100, this edition not only includes an authentic NES cartridge but also a detailed manual that dives into the game's troubled history and Oberth's career, shedding light on the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit gaming history.

The significance of this release extends beyond mere nostalgia; it highlights the importance of preserving video game history. As technology evolves, many classic games risk being forgotten or lost forever. The profits from this release will support the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, ensuring that future generations can appreciate the artistry and innovation of early video games. 

As we look forward to the release of Xcavator, one can't help but wonder: what other hidden gems from gaming's past are waiting to be unearthed?
