In a bold move that echoes the legacy of Valve's iconic Portal series, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**. With the cheeky claim that "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did," the developers are setting high expectations for a game that promises to deliver a unique puzzle-solving experience. The comparison to Portal is ambitious, but it also highlights the ongoing hunger for innovative puzzle games in the gaming community.

ChromaGun 2 takes players into a vibrant world where they wield a gun that transforms objects into various colors, reminiscent of the original ChromaGun released in 2016. While the gameâ€™s aesthetic and setting may draw parallels to Portal, the gameplay mechanics are more akin to titles like Qube and Qube 2, focusing on colored blocks rather than the iconic portals. This shift could appeal to fans looking for fresh challenges while still enjoying the essence of puzzle-solving that made Portal a classic.

For those eager to dive in, a free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to test their skills before the full release. With the original ChromaGun receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews, expectations are high for this sequel. As we look forward to its launch, one has to wonder: will ChromaGun 2 carve out its own legacy in the puzzle genre, or will it simply be seen as a tribute to the games that came before it?
