The release of iRacing's NASCAR 25 Console Game marks a significant moment for racing enthusiasts, as it brings one of the largest selections of base paint schemes seen in a NASCAR game in recent years. This multi-platform title not only revives the excitement for console racing but also introduces fans to a diverse array of designs, thanks to the inclusion of the three NASCAR National Series and the ARCA Menards Series.

While some notable paint schemes and sponsors are missing from the game, such as those from Monster Energy and certain alcoholic beverage brands, the game still showcases fan-favorite designs like Red Bull, making its return to the NASCAR gaming scene after a long hiatus. This blend of nostalgia and new content is sure to captivate both veteran players and newcomers alike.

As we look forward to future updates and expansions in the iRacing universe, its exciting to ponder what other iconic paint schemes might make their way into the game. Which paint scheme are you most eager to see in future releases?
