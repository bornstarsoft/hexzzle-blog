In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement not only sets high expectations but also taps into the nostalgia of a gaming community that has longed for a true sequel to one of the most beloved puzzle games, Portal 2. While Valve has shied away from creating a Portal 3, Pixel Maniacs is stepping in to fill that void with their unique twist on the genre.

ChromaGun 2 invites players into a vibrant world where they utilize a color-changing gun to solve puzzles, reminiscent of the mechanics found in Portal. However, the gameplay leans more towards the style of **Qube** and **Qube 2**, focusing on colored blocks rather than the iconic portals. This fresh approach could appeal to both fans of the original ChromaGun and newcomers looking for a challenging and visually engaging experience. With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of what this sequel has to offer before its full release.

As Pixel Maniacs continues to build on their reputation from the first ChromaGun, which received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, the anticipation for ChromaGun 2 is palpable. This game not only aims to capture the essence of classic puzzle-solving but also brings a new flair that could redefine the genre. Will ChromaGun 2 live up to its bold claims and fill the gap left by Portal? Only time will tell, but the excitement surrounding this indie title is certainly growing.
