In a world increasingly reliant on technology, the fight against job scams, particularly in international employment, has taken a significant leap forward. HR tech company Incruit has announced the implementation of AI monitoring to enhance the verification process of job postings, aiming to protect job seekers from fraudulent offers. This initiative comes at a time when overseas job scams have become a pressing social issue, highlighting the need for robust measures in the recruitment sector.

Incruit's approach includes automatic keyword filtering to block suspicious job listings that contain terms like 'high salary' or 'high income.' Moreover, they require detailed information about the job conditions, such as working hours and responsibilities, to be clearly stated when posting international job offers. If the conditions are unclear, Incruit promptly removes or closes the listings, ensuring that only legitimate opportunities are available to job seekers.

The introduction of AI monitoring, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to analyze new job postings, further strengthens the verification process. This multi-faceted strategy not only enhances the credibility of job listings but also underscores Incruit's commitment to safeguarding job seekers in an era where scams are becoming more sophisticated. As we look to the future, how can other companies adopt similar technologies to foster a safer job market for everyone?
