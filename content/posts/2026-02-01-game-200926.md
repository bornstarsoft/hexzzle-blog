In the realm of gaming, cozy experiences often come with a sense of relaxation and comfort. However, some games on Steam take this notion and turn it on its head, challenging players to think differently. These titles not only provide a cozy atmosphere but also encourage players to reshape their understanding of gameplay mechanics and narrative through unique perspectives.

One standout title is **Viewfinder**, where players can manipulate the environment by taking pictures and placing them strategically to create new pathways. This innovative approach allows for exploration and puzzle-solving in a way that feels fresh and engaging. Similarly, **Gorogoa** invites players to rearrange beautifully hand-drawn panels to solve intricate puzzles, redefining how we interact with art in gaming. Lastly, **Superliminal** offers a dream-like experience that plays with perspective, making players rethink their approach to puzzles in a world where nothing is as it seems.

These games remind us that cozy doesnt always mean simple; sometimes, it requires us to engage in deeper thought and creativity. What other cozy games have you encountered that challenge your perspective in unexpected ways?
