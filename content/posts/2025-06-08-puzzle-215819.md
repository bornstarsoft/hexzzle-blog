In a world where gaming often revolves around high-stakes action or complex strategies, **Instants** offers a refreshing take by inviting players to engage with a family's narrative through the art of scrapbooking. This story-rich puzzle game, launched during the Wholesome Direct, allows players to piece together cherished memories by organizing photo albums that capture significant life events. From learning to ride a bike to family vacations, each scrapbook serves as a portal to nostalgia, making it a unique experience that resonates with players on a personal level.

What sets Instants apart is its blend of creativity and storytelling. Players aren't just solving puzzles; they're customizing their scrapbooks with stickers, washi tapes, and other decorative elements, allowing for a deeply personal touch. The game encourages players to immerse themselves in the narrative, unlocking new decorations as they progress, which adds layers of engagement and keeps the experience fresh. The inclusion of a helpful on-screen cat for hints ensures that players can enjoy a relaxing gaming session without the frustration of getting stuck.

As you navigate through the family's journey across generations, the challenge of organizing photos becomes more complex, mirroring the intricacies of real-life memories. Instants is perfect for those who enjoy cozy gaming experiences, reminiscent of titles like *A Little to the Left*. It invites players to take their time, savoring each moment as they craft their own story. Will you dive into the world of Instants and create your own scrapbook of memories?
