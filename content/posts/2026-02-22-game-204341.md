Ubisoft's CEO, Yves Guillemot, has recently confirmed that the company is actively developing multiple titles under the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry franchises. This announcement comes amid significant restructuring within the company, which has seen a shift towards creating autonomous creative teams and a commitment to enhancing player engagement across both single-player and multiplayer experiences.

Guillemot emphasized the importance of these franchises, noting that the Assassin's Creed community alone surpassed 30 million players last year. With two promising Far Cry projects also in the works, the company appears to be doubling down on its flagship series despite recent challenges, including layoffs and game cancellations.

As Ubisoft navigates this transformative phase, the focus remains on delivering high-quality gaming experiences while maintaining transparency with its teams. Will these new developments rejuvenate the beloved franchises and satisfy the gaming community's expectations?
