In a recent live stream, Naoki Yoshida, the series producer of Final Fantasy, hinted that a port of Final Fantasy 16 to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 could be on the horizon. This revelation comes on the heels of the game's recent announcement for Xbox Series X/S, marking a significant shift in Square Enix's strategy towards multiplatform releases. With Yoshida stating that “it’s just Nintendo left,” fans are buzzing with excitement over the potential for this beloved title to reach a broader audience.

The move towards a multiplatform strategy is a notable change for Square Enix, especially after the disappointing sales figures for both Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16. The company has acknowledged the impact of exclusivity on sales and is now looking to create a more inclusive gaming environment. This shift not only opens doors for existing titles but also suggests that future releases may follow suit, potentially expanding the Final Fantasy universe to even more players.

As we await further announcements, the prospect of Final Fantasy 16 on the Nintendo Switch 2 raises intriguing questions about the future of gaming exclusivity. Will this be the beginning of a new trend for major franchises, or will we see a return to platform-specific releases? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the gaming landscape is evolving, and fans are eager to see where it leads.
