Indie game developers Team Afternoon are set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026. This free-to-play title, inspired by the nostalgic Windows 98 aesthetic, invites players to step into the shoes of a video editor tasked with creating a "fake clear video" from a failed dungeon raid. This unique concept not only challenges traditional gaming roles but also offers a fresh take on storytelling through irony and satire.

At the heart of the game lies an 8-tick timeline editing mechanic that requires players to meticulously arrange clips of various actions to craft a flawless narrative of victory. The emphasis on precision and creativity transforms mundane gameplay into an art form, allowing players to manipulate the raw chaos of a failed raid into a heroic tale. As players engage with the game, they will find themselves navigating the delicate balance between crafting a compelling story and the harsh reality of the game's chaotic events.

"Don't You Trust Me?" promises to blend turn-based strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation genres, providing a unique experience that resonates with both nostalgic gamers and modern players alike. As we approach its release, one can't help but wonder: how will this innovative approach to game design influence the future of indie games?
